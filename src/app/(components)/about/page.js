            <p>
            I recently graduated from a full stack software engineering program. The constant development required as a software engineer suits my aptitude for learning. I bring with me a diverse set of skills, including experience in the accounting industry, a fixed-wing private pilot license, musical knowledge, and an eye for design. Iâ€™m the multitool you want in your back pocket.
